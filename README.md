### 1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget

**Tag: Sliding Window, Double Pointers**

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `maxCost`.

You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i`th character of `s` to `i`th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` athat can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`. If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t, so the maximum length is 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0;
Output: 1
Explanation: You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
```

### 131. Palindrome Partitioning

**Tag： Dynamic Programming, Backtrace**

Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a **palindrome**. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

A **palindrome** string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a", "a", "b"], ["aa", "b"]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]
```

### 1770. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations

**Tag: Dynamic Programming**

You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`. The arrays are **1-indexed**.

You begin with a score of `0`. You want to perform **exactly** `m` operations. On the `i`th operation **(1-indexed)**, you will:

- Choose one integer `x` from **either the start or the end** of the array `nums`.
- Add `multipliers[i] * x` to your score.
- Remove `x` from the array `nums`.

Return *the **maximum** score after performing* `m` *operations*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
Output: 14
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.
The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]
Output: 102
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the start, [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7,1], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score. 
The total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.
```

### 1818. Minimum Absolute Sum Difference

**Tag: Sorting, Binary Search**

You are given two positive integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`.

The **absolute sum difference** of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is defined as the **sum** of `|nums1[i] - nums2[i]|` for each `0 <= i < n` (**0-indexed**).

You can replace **at most one** element of `nums1` with **any** other element in `nums1` to **minimize** the absolute sum difference.

Return the *minimum absolute sum difference **after** replacing at most one element in the array `nums1`*. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** $10^9 + 7$.

`|x|` is defined as:

- `x` if `x >= 0`, or
- `-x` if `x < 0`. 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two possible optimal solutions:
- Replace the second element with the first: [1,7,5] => [1,1,5], or
- Replace the second element with the third: [1,7,5] => [1,5,5].
Both will yield an absolute sum difference of |1-2| + (|1-3| or |5-3|) + |5-5| = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums1 is equal to nums2 so no replacement is needed. This will result in an 
absolute sum difference of 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,10,4,4,2,7], nums2 = [9,3,5,1,7,4]
Output: 20
Explanation: Replace the first element with the second: [1,10,4,4,2,7] => [10,10,4,4,2,7].
This yields an absolute sum difference of |10-9| + |10-3| + |4-5| + |4-1| + |2-7| + |7-4| = 20
```

### 1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves

**Tag: Sorting**

You are given an integer array `nums`. In one move, you can choose one element of `nums` and change it by **any value**.

Return the *minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of `nums` after performing **at most three moves***.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2].
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
Output: 1
Explanation: Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1,1,0,1,1]. 
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.
```

### 638. Shopping Offers

**Tag: DFS, Memorization**

In LeetCode Store, there are `n` items to sell. Each item has a price. However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given an integer array `price` where `price[i]` is the price of the `i`th item, and an integer array `needs` where `needs[i]` is the number of pieces of the `i`th item you want to buy.

You are also given an array `special` where `special[i]` is of size `n + 1` where `special[i][j]` is the number of pieces of the `j`th item in the `i`th offer and `special[i][n]` (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the `i`th offer.

Return *the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers.* You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. You could use any of the special offers as many times as you want.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: price = [2,5], special = [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], needs = [3,2]
Output: 14
Explanation: There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. 
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: price = [2,3,4], special = [[1,1,0,4],[2,2,1,9]], needs = [1,2,1]
Output: 11
Explanation: The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. 
You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. 
You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C. 
You cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.
```

### 1648. Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls

**Tag: Sorting, Greedy**

You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls of **any** color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls **of that color** you currently have in your `inventory`. For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `i`th color that you initially own. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls **in any order**.

Return *the **maximum** total value that you can attain after selling `orders` colored balls.* As the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).
The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: inventory = [3,5], orders = 6
Output: 19
Explanation: Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).
The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.
```

### 1738. Find Kth Largest XOR Coordinate Value

You are given a 2D `matrix` of size `m x n`, consisting of non-negative integers. You are also given an integer `k`.

The **value** of coordinate `(a, b)` of the matrix is the XOR of all `matrix[i][j]` where `0 <= i <= a < m` and `0 <= j <= b < n` **(0-indexed)**.

Find the `k`th largest value **(1-indexed)** of all the coordinates of `matrix`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 1
Output: 7
Explanation: The value of coordinate (0,1) is 5 XOR 2 = 7, which is the largest value.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The value of coordinate (0,0) is 5 = 5, which is the 2nd largest value.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The value of coordinate (1,0) is 5 XOR 1 = 4, which is the 3rd largest value.
```

### 1288. Remove Covered Intervals

**Tag: Sorting**

Given an array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [li, ri]` represent the interval `[li, ri)`, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.

The interval `[a, b)` is covered by the interval `[c, d)` if and only if `c <= a` and `b <= d`.

Return *the number of remaining intervals*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: 1
```

### 462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II

**Tag: Sorting, Median**

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return *the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal*.

In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by `1`.

Test cases are designed so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,10,2,9]
Output: 16
```

### 1845. Seat Reservation Manager

**Tag: Minheap**

Design a system that manages the reservation state of `n` seats that are numbered from `1` to `n`.

Implement the `SeatManager` class:

- `SeatManager(int n)` Initializes a `SeatManager` object that will manage `n` seats numbered from `1` to `n`. All seats are initially available.
- `int reserve()` Fetches the **smallest-numbered** unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
- `void unreserve(int seatNumber)` Unreserves the seat with the given `seatNumber`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["SeatManager", "reserve", "reserve", "unreserve", "reserve", "reserve", "reserve", "reserve", "unreserve"]
[[5], [], [], [2], [], [], [], [], [5]]
Output
[null, 1, 2, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null]

Explanation
SeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); // Initializes a SeatManager with 5 seats.
seatManager.reserve();    // All seats are available, so return the lowest numbered seat, which is 1.
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
seatManager.unreserve(2); // Unreserve seat 2, so now the available seats are [2,3,4,5].
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 3.
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 4.
seatManager.reserve();    // The only available seat is seat 5, so return 5.
seatManager.unreserve(5); // Unreserve seat 5, so now the available seats are [5].

### 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

**Tag: DFS, Binary Tree**

You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

- For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return *the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers*. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3] (in level-order)
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

### 837. New 21 Game

**Tag: Dynamic Programming, Probability**

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game **"21"**.

Alice starts with `0` points and draws numbers while she has less than `k` points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, maxPts]`, where `maxPts` is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `k` or **more points**.

Return the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.

Answers within `10^(-5)` of the actual answer are considered accepted.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.
```

### 210. Course Schedule II

**Tag: Topological Sort, BFS**

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return *the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses*. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```

### 712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings

**Tag: Dynamic Programming**
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return *the lowest **ASCII** sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"
Output: 231
Explanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the sum.
Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"
Output: 403
Explanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let",
adds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.
Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.
```

### 554. Brick Wall

**Tag: Hash map**

There is a rectangular brick wall in front of you with `n` rows of bricks. The `ith` row has some number of bricks each of the same height (i.e., one unit) but they can be of different widths. The total width of each row is the same.

Draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks. If your line goes through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.

Given the 2D array `wall` that contains the information about the wall, return *the minimum number of crossed bricks after drawing such a vertical line.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: wall = [[1,2,2,1],[3,1,2],[1,3,2],[2,4],[3,1,2],[1,3,1,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: wall = [[1],[1],[1]]
Output: 3

### 721. Accounts Merge

**Tag: Hash map, Union set**

Given a list of `accounts` where each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are **emails** representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails **in sorted order**. The accounts themselves can be returned in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Output: [["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Explanation:
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: accounts = [["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan0@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],["Fern","Fern5@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]]
Output: [["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern5@m.co"]]

### 240. Search a 2D Matrix II

**Tag: Binary Search**

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

### 713. Subarray Product Less Than K

**Tag: Sliding window**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than* `k`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 0
Output: 0
```

### 518. Coin Change 2

**Tag: Dynamic Programming**

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return *the number of combinations that make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
Output: 1
```

### 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

**Tag: Binary Tree**

Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the `right` child pointer points to the next node in the list and the `left` child pointer is always `null`.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a **pre-order traversal** of the binary tree.

**Example 1 (in level order):**

```
Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### 1529. Minimum Suffix Flips

**Tag: Simulation**

You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `target` of length `n`. You have another binary string `s` of length `n` that is initially set to all zeros. You want to make `s` equal to `target`.

In one operation, you can pick an index `i` where `0 <= i < n` and flip all bits in the **inclusive** range `[i, n - 1]`. Flip means changing `'0'` to `'1'` and `'1'` to `'0'`.

Return *the minimum number of operations needed to make* `s` *equal to* `target`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = "10111"
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, s = "00000".
Choose index i = 2: "00000" -> "00111"
Choose index i = 0: "00111" -> "11000"
Choose index i = 1: "11000" -> "10111"
We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = "101"
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, s = "000".
Choose index i = 0: "000" -> "111"
Choose index i = 1: "111" -> "100"
Choose index i = 2: "100" -> "101"
We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: target = "00000"
Output: 0
Explanation: We do not need any operations since the initial s already equals target.
```

### 743. Network Delay Time

**Tag: Minheap, Graph, Dijkstra**

You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
Output: -1
```

### 1922. Count Good Numbers

**Tag: Fast Power**

A digit string is **good** if the digits **(0-indexed)** at **even** indices are **even** and the digits at **odd** indices are **prime** (`2`, `3`, `5`, or `7`).

- For example, `"2582"` is good because the digits (`2` and `8`) at even positions are even and the digits (`5` and `2`) at odd positions are prime. However, `"3245"` is **not** good because `3` is at an even index but is not even.

Given an integer `n`, return *the **total** number of good digit strings of length* `n`. Since the answer may be large, **return it modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

A **digit string** is a string consisting of digits `0` through `9` that may contain leading zeros.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: The good numbers of length 1 are "0", "2", "4", "6", "8".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 400
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 50
Output: 564908303
```

### 135. Candy

**Tag: Greedy**

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return *the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

### 1324. Print Words Vertically

Given a string `s`. Return all the words vertically in the same order in which they appear in `s`.
Words are returned as a list of strings, complete with spaces when is necessary. (Trailing spaces are not allowed).
Each word would be put on only one column and that in one column there will be only one word.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "HOW ARE YOU"
Output: ["HAY","ORO","WEU"]
Explanation: Each word is printed vertically. 
 "HAY"
 "ORO"
 "WEU"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
Output: ["TBONTB","OEROOE","   T"]
Explanation: Trailing spaces is not allowed. 
"TBONTB"
"OEROOE"
"   T"
```

### 2110. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock

You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on the `ith` day.

A **smooth descent period** of a stock consists of **one or more contiguous** days such that the price on each day is **lower** than the price on the **preceding day** by **exactly** `1`. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

Return *the number of **smooth descent periods***.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [3,2,1,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 smooth descent periods:
[3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1]
Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [8,6,7,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7]
Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 ≠ 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]
```
