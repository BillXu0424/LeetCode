### 1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `maxCost`.

You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i`th character of `s` to `i`th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`. If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t, so the maximum length is 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0;
Output: 1
Explanation: You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
```

### 131. Palindrome Partitioning

Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a **palindrome**. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

A **palindrome** string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a", "a", "b"], ["aa", "b"]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]
```

### 1770. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations

You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`. The arrays are **1-indexed**.

You begin with a score of `0`. You want to perform **exactly** `m` operations. On the `i`th operation **(1-indexed)**, you will:

- Choose one integer `x` from **either the start or the end** of the array `nums`.
- Add `multipliers[i] * x` to your score.
- Remove `x` from the array `nums`.

Return *the **maximum** score after performing* `m` *operations*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
Output: 14
Explanation:Â An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.
The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]
Output: 102
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the start, [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7,1], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score. 
The total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.
